A. Succinctly put, the project is a simple rpg. There are two versions, a command line and GUI version. Both versions involve navigating around a world of some sort.
B. Currently, the command line version can let you walk and do combat. The GUI version just allows you to walk and buy from a shop.
C. The software currently runs, there are 2 mains for the 2 different versions.
D. The GUI version can easily be improved. Aside from a general UI overhaul, the movement is buggy and there is currently no way to initalize combat with the enemy.
E. The README is pretty good, it helps clear the confusion. However, there is so many class relationships and dependencies that a UML diagram would be very helpful.
F. Build.xml is a little cluttered and could do with some changes.
G. There are definitely enough points to earn 1000 points, and as for requirements it pretty clear.
H. I would add a new issue, in that there is a bug with the player movement. Changing directions is actually delayed, so you won't actually change directions until your next input.
I. The code is incredibly unorganized. There are classes that do very little orcould be removed. It took me an entire hour just to realize that there were 2 different mains for the two versions because I had to check each and every class to get an understanding for their dependencies. There is no folders, and because of this, I have no inherit understanding on any of the class relationships. In order to just get started, I would have to create a UML diagram so I can begin to understand where all the underlying issues are. Right now I have no complaints about the logic behind the code, simply because I can't understand it, but based on what I think I understand, the logic is also incredibly flawed. The usage of GUI in the code is also terrible, and makes the entire thing look really ugly. Because of all these issues, there is no clear starting point in how to actually begin fixing this code.
J. There is absolutely no test coverage in this code. Adding any sort of test coverage would be incredibly useful.
