* This project, as the name implies, is a simple rpg. It has a character that moves around a generated map and fights enemies (well, at least that's the goal).

* Story 1: As a MainCharacter I can respond to arrow key presses so that the user can move me around.
  Story 2: As a Display I can visually depict the main character's health/experience and so that the user can understand the stats of the character.
  Story 3: As a Shop I can show a weapons list so that the main character can buy them.

* The software, in its current state, is able to run. Compiling and running the program either brings up a CLI or brings up a GUI, which displays a green background with blue borders and the main character's stats. The GUI also has a stick figure that is able to move about the green background with the arrow keys and a large "Go to shop" button in the EAST region.

* Story 1: As a MainCharacter I can battle enemies so that I can get gold.
  Story 2: As a Shop I can exchange gold for inventory items so that the main character can utilize them.
  Story 3: As a Enemy I can battle the main character so that the user has a game objective.

* The README.md file is fairly detailed. It includes details on how to run and compile the code (for both the CLI and the GUI) and a history of the project. However, in the Project History, it mostly details the features of the CLI, while largely neglecting the GUI. Since it is explained that the GUI is "non-functional," it would be helpful to outline what the main issues are with it or the reasons why it may not be running properly.

* The build.xml file is fully functional and has many useful commands outside the expected build, clean, run, and test such as 'ant jar' (creates a jar file), 'ant init' (move files from src to bin), and 'ant download' (makes downloadable files). Each command works as expected and the program can be lauched in a gui or command line form using the ant command. The 'ant clean' command will remove files generated from the init, jar, or javadoc commands, as expected. 

* There appears to be a large number of issues and incomplete features that could be tweaked or fixed, especially in the GUI. (However, it also looks like the CUI could use some added features). Even though it is clear, in a broad sense, what needs to be fixed or added, it seems like there could be several different methods of fixing the issues and many different options in terms of possible additional features.

* No additional issues added at this time.

* In terms of the organization of the code, it is fairly clear and legible. The project includes separate classes for the CLI and GUI display (with various classes for displaying the layout of the world of the game), along with displays for the "shop" and "battle display." As it stands, both the shop display and the battle displays are barely functional, with the battle display only having a default constructor and the shop being unable to sell items in its current state. However, the outlines for the classes are there. The project includes various classes for the different entity types: "enemy," "goblin," and "main character." The Main Character class currently has a default constructor and a copy constructor, which takes a main character as its parameters. The Enemy class is an abstract class with a constructor, several getters for different stats, and various functions for attacks. The Goblin is a subclass of the Enemy class, with a constructor and various functions for attacking and giving a reward. The Reward class handles how the main character gets their reward after a battle, with functions for giving the main character xp and gold. We also have a "game" class, which initializes a new game with a new main character instance and initializes a tile grid for the GUI. Finally, we have a "Simple RPG" class, which contains our main function, that constructs our window and JPanel. These classes outline the GUI, but the CLI also has its own classes, one that handles the actual progression of the game while the other handles the output.

* As it stands, there is very little test coverage. There are only tests for the Main Character class' movement functions. It seems that we could add tests for the Enemy and Goblin classes' attacking and reward functions, along with the attacking functions for the Main Character class. Tests could also be added for the various functions related to buying and selling from the shop. Also, it may be beneficial to test the Tile class and how the Display class relates to it (how the GUI outputs and creates the map).
