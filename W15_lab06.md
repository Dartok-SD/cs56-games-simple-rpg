Vivek Patel, Boris Sadykoff

* GUI is completely broken, only generates random water tiles amongst a full grass map 

* Command line interface of game works well but is inconvenient

* Many Java source files without proper comments

* Many typos and syntax errors and inconsistencies( CLI.java is mostly broken because of broken methods within it(e.g battleState())

* battle encounters are not managed properly

* should add more enemy types

* fixed some of the CLI.java already

* had issues with the build.xml file and fixed one of the errors(Vivek)
